# LayerCI

We're the easiest way to give dozens of staging servers per developer.
All you have to do is configure how to set them up, and we'll create one for every change a developer makes.

You can:
1. Share a link to view a website on the staging server
2. Run end-to-end tests in the staging server
3. Run unit tests or linting in your staging server
4. Use a terminal to edit things in your staging servers

It's free for the first two developers!
